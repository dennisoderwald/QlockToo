QlockTwo Remake
===============

In this repository you find the software, firmware and hardware design for a QlockTwo Remake built by four master students of the "Westfälische Hochschule".

We use an Arduino Micro as the central microcontroller. The software is written in PySide.

We have just started with this project, so don't expect to find much here.
